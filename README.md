My personal website.

This site is basically a snapshot of who I am and what I’m currently working on.  
It includes:

- A short bio and background
- Topics I’m currently excited about
- Contact information

My goal with this site is to share my journey in AI and data engineering, showcase ongoing projects, and make it easier for people to connect with me professionally.
